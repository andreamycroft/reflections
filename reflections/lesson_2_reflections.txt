What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository it creates the hidden
	file <.git> which does not contain any commits.
	The initial commit is empty because you haven't made
	any commits yet. If you enter <git status> it will tell you
	that no commits have been made. You can view hidden files
	with the command <dir /a> You need to create the git repo
	so that you can start tracking your commits/changes. All
	of your files initially are untracked files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is like an in between stage between the working directory
	and the repository. You move files there before you create a commit based
	on those files in the staging area. This is valuable because you can group
	files together that you want to commit, and leave the ones that don't make 
	sense behind in the working directory.'
